# Check sample template

This is a sample project in CDK which creates a VPC with 3 different types of subnets.
If you have multiple aws profiles set up on your machine, please specify the profile to be used when deploying the template.
`--profile [profile-name]`

## Useful commands
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
